      <title>YES/NO Boolean Env Vars</title>

      <description>I use YES and NO in environment variables to store Boolean values. I have come to the conclusion that this is in some way optimal after trying all the other obvious options and finding that each has readability flaws:
 0 and 1 are confusing in POSIX shells like bash, because return 0 and exit 0 usually mean &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; (the command did not fail) which we think of as truthy. Likewise, 1 or any other non-zero number is treated as failure in these contexts, which intuitively feels falseish.</description>

      <title>Hugo Makefile</title>

      <description>This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages and published using Hugo. Since Go is my preferred language at the moment, Hugo seemed attractive.
There are 2 Git repos for this website:
 Source code: github.com/fieldnotes-tech/fieldnotes.tech Rendered static site: github.com/fieldnotes-tech/fieldnotes-tech.github.io  Publishing involves updating the source, and having Hugo generate the static site. To make this easier to use I&amp;rsquo;ve added a Makefile which pulls the rendered site as a submodule in the public/ directory, which is Hugo&amp;rsquo;s default place to write the rendered site.</description>

      <description>Hello world, welcome to fieldnotes.tech!
Here I intend to keep my notes-to-self, code snippets, musings and other short bits &amp;amp; pieces on the subject of software engineering and tech in general. Most of what Iâ€™ll write here will be gleaned from working in the field and solving real issues as they arise. Some of it will be pretty esoteric, rough, unfinished and maybe even controversial or just plain wrong; but all will be in the spirit of earnestly trying to be better at what I do.</description>
