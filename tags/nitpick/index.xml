      <description>I use YES and NO in environment variables to store Boolean values. I have come to the conclusion that this is in some way optimal after trying all the other obvious options and finding that each has readability flaws:
 0 and 1 are confusing in POSIX shells like bash, because return 0 and exit 0 usually mean &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; (the command did not fail) which we think of as truthy. Likewise, 1 or any other non-zero number is treated as failure in these contexts, which intuitively feels falseish.</description>
